    <p>In seventeenth-century England, pamphlets were a good way to spread ideas quickly. These pamphlets were like small leaflets that would be printed and then distrubuted
    among people who lived in the cities. They would usually contain texts that were political or religious in nature, with the aim of spreading some sort of ideoly, or
    sometimes news. This was all during a time when literacy rates were rising, so pamphlets were an effective tool in spreading information.</p>
