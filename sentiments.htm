          Overall, it seems like sentiments in the seventeenth-century pamphlets aren't trending in one particular direction until around 1640, where they seem to go
          down a lot. Then once again they seem to drop in the late seventies to eighties. The period between 1642 and 1651 was marked by the English Civil War, which
          could explain lots of the negative sentiment found in pamphlets. 1679 is when the Exclusion Crisis started, where people were concerned about King Charles II's
          brother succeeding King Charles II to the throne, given that he was a Catholic and there was lots of anti-Catholic discourse going on around this time. This sparked
          heated debates between the Whigs and the Tories, which likely left many people feeling angry about the political state of England at the time. This could explain
          the negative sentiment in pamphlets during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1625, sentiments in pamphlets seemed to be particularly low compared to the rest of the decade,
          perhaps due to the death of King James I, who was succeeded by Charles I. This marked the start of growing political tensions, mainly concerning Royal authority and
          religion. The English Parliament fell, and England attempted to challenge Spanish power by initiating the Cádiz Expedition, which ultimately failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pamphlets from 1635 also show a particularly negative sentiment. This could be due to the Ship Money Tax,
          which Charles I implemented during this year. Many people were not happy with this and saw it as an illegal form of taxation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1660, King Charles II returned from exile in France to become king end end Puritan rule. This reasserted the role
          of the Monarchy in the government, even though the relationship between the king and Parliament still wasn't optimal. This year marked the start of a cultural revival,
          with many theatres that had been close during the Puritan rule, reopening. The sciences also experienced a revival.

      <h3>Negative and positive words</h3>
      <p>Below is an overview of most occuring words that contribute to either the positive or negative sentiment of the pamphlets.</p>
      <p><img src="sent_contr.png"></p>
      <p style="width:40%;">The most occuring word that contributes to positive sentiment is 'majesty'. This may have skewed the sentiment analysis slightly, given that 
      this word didn't nessecarily have a positive connotation in the time these pamphlets were produced; it was simply a neutral yet respectful way to
      refer to a person within the monarchy. The words that contribute to negative sentiments show that it was often pamphlets talking about death - whether
      this was people who died in war or the death of some important political or religious figure. Sin is also an important word contributing to negative 
      sentiments, showing the religious nature that a lot of these pamphlets had.</p>
